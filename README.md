# Dirt-Simple-Server-Backup
Simple as dirt.  Just makes files based on stuff.

Just bzips up some directories and tosses them in a directory with timestamps.
Designed to have the "type" of backup appended as an argument in a crontab, or command line execution.

You may want to chmod +x this file, if you want it to run crontab.
